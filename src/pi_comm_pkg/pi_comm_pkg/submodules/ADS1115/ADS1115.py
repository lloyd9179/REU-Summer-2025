ADS1115.py
Function: A simple class to operate an ADS1115 over I2C on an RPi with Python
ADS1115 is 4 channel a 16-bit ADC which operates over I2C
Author: Benjamin Walt
Date: 4/19/2021
Purpose: SoftAgBot system integration project
Version: 0.1
This is a (light) rework of Adafruit's software:
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15
https://www.adafruit.com/product/1085
There are more features which are not implemented here.
